prg02.c: (in function main)
prg02.c:29:14: Function memset expects arg 2 to be int gets char: '\0'
  A character constant is used as an int. Use +charintliteral to allow
  character constants to be used as ints.  (This is safe since the actual type
  of a char constant is int.)
prg02.c:29:9: Possibly null storage str passed as non-null param:
                 memset (str, ...)
  A possibly null pointer is passed as a parameter corresponding to a formal
  parameter with no /*@null@*/ annotation.  If NULL may be used for this
  parameter, add a /*@null@*/ annotation to the function parameter declaration.
  (Use -nullpass to inhibit warning)
   prg02.c:28:14: Storage str may become null
prg02.c:5:6: Function exported but not used outside prg02: conv2Str
  A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. Declaration can
  use static qualifier. (Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
